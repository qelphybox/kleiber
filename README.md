## Description

Kleiber provides an interface for control multiple vagrant machines. In case when you have distributed system of applications, each application have its vagrant machine and you need to manage system locally in development order Kleiber may be useful.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kleiber'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kleiber

## Usage
### Projects config
At first you need to compose projects config. It's `.yml` file with structure like that:

    ---
    projects:
      project1:
      prefix: PROJ1 # prefix for environment variables with project settings
        dir: /path/to/project/dir
        guest_port: 8000
        host_port: 8000
        host: 125.12.123.42
        tasks:
          setup: 'npm install'
          run: 'node start'

      project2:
        prefix: PROJ2

      project3:
        prefix: PROJ3

    tasks:
      setup: 'bundle install --jobs 4'
      run: 'bundle exec rails s -p %{guest_port}'
      console: 'bundle exec rails c'
You can create tasks as many as you want and name it as you need.

### Command Line Interface
Sample command struture is `kleiber [vagrant command] <project names> <-c config_path> <-t tasks divided by colon (:)>`.

    $ kleiber up
    $ kleiber halt project1 project2
    $ kleiber ssh -t setup:run
    $ kleiber --help # use it first

`bin/setup` - install dependecies and setup app.
`bundle exec rspec` - to run tests.
